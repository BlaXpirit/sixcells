## How to Use

### Player

Open a level or paste one from clipboard and play it.  
Loading multiple levels at once is supported. Use the tab bar to switch between them.

Left-click/right-click an orange cell to reveal it as blue/black. In case of a mistake the cell will not be revealed.  
Press Z to undo.  

Shift + left-click/right-click an orange cell to annotate it as blue/black. Repeat this to clear the annotation.  
Annotations don't affect anything, they're just marks. Revealing a cell will clear the annotation regardless of its color.  
*Edit* menu also contains options to clear all the annotations, confirm them (as if all of the annotated cells were clicked with a matching color) or deny them (...clicked with the opposite color).  
See also: [Text annotations](#annotations)

When you close a level, you will have an option to save the current progress. It will be loaded automatically next time. There is an option to clear progress.

If you use the *Player* to playtest right from *Editor*, it will save state between sessions.  
Right click to revert a cell to yellow.  

Full auto-solving capabilities are present.

## Installation

### Windows

Download the newest *-win32.zip* [**release**](https://github.com/oprypin/sixcells/releases), extract the folder and you're ready to go!

### Linux

Install `git`, `python-pyqt5` or `python-pyside`, `python-pulp` (`pip install pulp`), optionally `glpk`:

- Debian, Ubuntu:

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install git python-pyqt5 glpk-utils python-pip
    sudo pip install pulp
    ```

Go to a folder where you would like *SixCells* to be and obtain the source code (a subdirectory "sixcells" will be created):
```bash
git clone https://github.com/oprypin/sixcells
```

Now you can start `editor.py` and `player.py` by opening them in a file explorer or from command line.

To update *SixCells* to the latest version without deleting and redownloading, execute `git pull` inside its directory.

#### Arch Linux

[**sixcells**](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/sixcells/) on *AUR*. Optional dependency is needed for solving.

### Mac

Make sure you have [installed *command line developer tools*](http://osxdaily.com/2014/02/12/install-command-line-tools-mac-os-x/).

[Install *Homebrew*](http://brew.sh/#install).

Use *Homebrew* and *pip* to install Python and the needed libraries:
```bash
brew install python3
pip3 install pyqt5 pulp
```

Go to a folder where you would like *SixCells* to be and obtain the source code (a subdirectory "sixcells" will be created):
```bash
